      "text": "Let’s talk, Short Range Photoelectric Detectors.

So often, the perimeter, that first line of defence is over looked, putting the whole system under greater pressure. By adding surveillance to the perimeter or boundary of the property, the effectiveness of a security system will be greatly increased, strengthening and improving crime protection to a property.",
