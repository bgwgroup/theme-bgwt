      "text": "Let’s talk, Short Range Photoelectric Detectors. When it comes to installing a security system, detectors are positioned inside a building and the monitoring station is alerted if an intruder is detected. So often, the perimeter, that first line of defence is over looked, putting the whole system under greater pressure. By adding surveillance to the perimeter or boundary of the property, the effectiveness of a security system will be greatly increased, strengthening and improving crime protection to a property.",
